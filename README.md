# 🌐 HTML Learning Journey

This project is a creative showcase of everything I learned in HTML, organized into 5 progressive levels.
Each level contains different syntax examples or mini-programs that represent key topics — such as headings, lists, forms, tables, links, and more.
It acts as both a personal reference and a visual learning roadmap.
The goal of this project was to solidify my understanding of core HTML concepts while practicing clean and structured coding. 
It's a great way to revisit topics or guide beginners through step-by-step learning.
